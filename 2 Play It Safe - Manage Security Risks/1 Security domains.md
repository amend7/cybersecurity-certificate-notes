## CISSP's 8 security domains

1. Security goals and risk management:
   - Defining security goals and objectives
   - Risk mitigation
      - Having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach
   - Compliance
   - Business continuity
        -  Relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
   - Legal regulations
2. Asset security:
   - Security digital & physical assets
   - Storage, maintenance, retention, destruction of data
   - Policies and procedures for the above
3. Security architecture and engineering:
   - Ensure effective tools / systems / processes are in place to protect assets & data
   - Shared responsibility: All individuals in an org take active role in lowering risk and maintaining security
4. Communication & network security:
   - Managing & securing physical networks / wireless comms
5. Identity & access management (IAM):
   - Identification (verify who they are e.g. username)
   - Authentication (verify their identity e.g. password / PIN)
   - Authorization (verify access)
   - Accountability (log actions)
6. Security assessment & testing:
   - Security control testing
   - Collecting & analysing data
   - Conducting security audits
7. Security operations:
   - Conducting investigations
   - Preventative measures
8. Software development security
   - Secure coding practices

## Risk

Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset (a digital / physical item having value to org). Can be a thought of as the likelihood of a threat occurring.

Vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

Levels of risk:

- Low-risk asset: Would not harm org's rep / ops, or financial damage if leaked.
- Medium-risk asset: May harm any of the above.
- High-risk asset: Protected by regulations / laws, e.g. IP, PII, SPII.

## Layers of web

- Surface: Day to day stuff.
- Deep: Unindexed, e.g. intranet / logged in data.
- Dark: Tor

## NIST Risk Management Framework's 7 steps for managing risk

- Prepare: Monitoring for risks, identifying ways to reduce.
- Categorise: Develop risk management processes and tasks.
- Select: Choose, customise, capture, docs of protecting controls. E.g. a playbook.
- Implement:
- Assess: Determine if current controls are implemented correctly.
- Authorise: Generating reports, developing plans, establishing milestones.
- Monitor: Observing & maintaining controls.

## OWASP

OWASP is still updated! Long time no see: <https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/>

## Feedback

All the positive feedback is a little jarring after plain, logical language. It's quite "American". E.g. "You did a fantastic job adding new knowledge to your security analyst toolkit ... Keep up the great work!".
